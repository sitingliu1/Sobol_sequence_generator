# Sobol_sequence_generator

This is a tool that uses MATLAB code to generate VHDL files for a hardware Sobol sequence generator developed by Siting Liu at the University of Alberta.

Currently, it has only one function, "direction_vector_generation.m", to generate the direction vector array used in the Sobol sequence generator [1]. More codes to come.

Please cite our work if using the codes.

Thanks.
